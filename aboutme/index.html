    <h2>Moroni Babia</h2>
    
    <p>Hello everyone! My name is Moroni Babia and I am from the Philippines. I served a mission for the Church back in 2000-2002 in the Philippines Cebu Mission. That's where me and my wife met. She was also serving as a missionary back then. We now have an 11-year old son, and we are currently residing in Mabalacat, Pampanga, Philipines. We are both serving as BYU Pathway Service Missionaries and are now handling a PC103 class.</p>

    <p>I am a Manager for a Knowledge Management team with RingCentral. I have been with my present company for over 8 years. Currently, my team is responsible for maintaining our internal support Knowledge Base and the implementation and adoption of Knowledge Centered Service as a knowledge management methodology for our internal tech support teams.</p>

    <p>I am currently pursuing Applied Tech as a BYU Pathway Worldwide student. I want to expand my technical skills in Web Development and Programming so that I can use it for data analysis and presentation, which is a very valuable skill to have in the knowledge management sphere.</p>

    <p>You can connect with me professionally on my <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/mababia/">LinkedIn Profile</a>.</p>
